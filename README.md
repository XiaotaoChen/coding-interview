## coding for interview
There are some implementations for algorithms that often appear in coding interviews. Those algorithmic questions come from leetcode and sword-finger-offer. Also analyses are in the `test.cc`.

#### How to run
```shell
make -j4
./test
```

#### How to add yourself implementation
 > 1. add coding implementations in your `.cc` and `.h` files
 > 2. make sure your `.cc` file are included in `Makefile`. if not include, you should add your file into `SRC_COM`.
 > 3. add test case in `test.cc`
 > 4. recompile this project `make -j4`
 > 5. run your test case: `./test`
